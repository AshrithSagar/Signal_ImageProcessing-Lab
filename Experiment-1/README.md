# Basic sequences and operations

## Examples

1. Generate and plot the unit sample sequence and delayed unit sample sequence with a delay 5.

2. Generate and plot the Unit-step sequence and delayed step sequence with a delay of 5.

3. Generate a complex exponential sequence and plot its real part, imaginary parts and magnitude.

4. Implement the three-point moving average algorithm (Signal smoothing by Averaging).

5. Generate and plot a Sinusoidal sequence of frequency 10 Hz sampled at a frequency 200 Hz.

## Exercises

1. Generate and plot sinusoidal signals of frequencies 20, 30 and 40Hz sampled at 500Hz.

2. Generate and plot a signal having superposition of frequencies 10, 30 and 60Hz sampled at 500Hz.

3. Generate and plot a random signal of length 100 whose elements are uniformly distributed in the interval [-2 2].

4. Sketch the following discrete-time signals in the time range of -10 ≤ n ≤ 10. If the sequence is complex, plot the magnitude and phase separately.

	- 𝑥(𝑛) = sin (𝑛𝜋) 𝑢(𝑛)
	- 𝑥(𝑛) = 0.5𝑛 𝑒𝑗𝜋𝑛/2
	- 𝑥(𝑛) = 10𝑒−0.3(𝑛−10)[𝑢(𝑛 − 10) − 𝑢(𝑛 − 20)], 0 ≤ n ≤ 20
	- 𝑥(𝑛) = 2𝛿(𝑛 + 2) − 𝛿(𝑛 − 4), −5 ≤ n ≤ 5

5. Implement the 5-point moving average algorithm and compare with example 4.
