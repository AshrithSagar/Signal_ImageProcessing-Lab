# Image Filtering

## Exercises

1. Write a program to add 'Salt and Pepper' type of noise to an image [Refer help for inbuilt function `imnoise`], and then filter it using 'neighborhood averaging'.

2. Write a function for median filtering of an image. The input arguments to this function are `image`, `mask size`.

3. Write a program to add 'Salt and Pepper' type of noise to an image, and then filter using the function defined in Q2. Verify the result using the inbuilt function [Refer help for inbuilt function `medfilt2`].

4. Write a program to detect the edges of an image using high pass filter mask.

5. Write a program to smoothen the edges in an image using the filters in frequency
domain. [Refer 'Image Processing toolbox']

6. Write a program to detect the edges in an image using the filters in frequency
domain.
