# Contrast Enhancement and Discrete Fourier Transform of an Image

## Exercises

1. Write a program to plot the histogram of an image (without inbuilt function). Verify the results using inbuilt function `imhist`.

2. Write a program to improve the contrast of an image using contrast stretching transformation.

3. Write a program to compute the DFT of an image (without inbuilt function).

4. Write a program to reconstruct the image from its DFT (without inbuilt function).

5. Repeat the previous program using inbuilt functions `fft2` and `ifft2`.

6. Write a program to display the DFT of a rotated image.
