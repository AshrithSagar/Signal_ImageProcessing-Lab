# Radon Transform and Connected Component Labelling

## Exercises

1. Write a program to find the Radon transform of a Modified Shepp-Logon Phantom (available in MATLAB) using inbuilt function `radon`. Also reconstruct the image from the projections using inbuilt function `iradon`. Note the effects of the number of projections.

2. Write a program to label connected components in a 2-D binary image (generate random logical matrices of size 10×10, 8×8, 12×12) using 4/8 connectivity using the inbuilt function `bwlabel`.
